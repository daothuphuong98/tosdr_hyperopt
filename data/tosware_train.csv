let 's try to sort things out first . ,0
we want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case . ,0
"before filing a claim against dropbox , you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting dispute-notice@dropbox.com . ",0
we 'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email . ,0
"if a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission , you or dropbox may bring a formal proceeding . ",0
"you and dropbox agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these terms or the services will be brought in the federal or state courts of san francisco county , california , subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below . ",1
both you and dropbox consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts . ,1
"if you reside in a country -lrb- for example , european union member states -rrb- with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts , this paragraph does n't affect those requirements . ",0
"if you 're a u.s. resident , you also agree to the following mandatory arbitration provisions : ",0
we both agree to arbitrate . ,0
"you and dropbox agree to resolve any claims relating to these terms or the services through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator , except as set forth under exceptions to agreement to arbitrate below . ",1
"this includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this `` mandatory arbitration provisions '' section , including its enforceability , revocability , or validity . ",0
opt-out of agreement to arbitrate . ,0
you can decline this agreement to arbitrate by clicking here and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first registering your account . ,0
"however , if you agreed to a previous version of these terms that allowed you to opt out of arbitration , your previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding . ",0
the american arbitration association -lrb- aaa -rrb- will administer the arbitration under its commercial arbitration rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes . ,0
"the arbitration will be held in the united states county where you live or work , san francisco -lrb- ca -rrb- , or any other location we agree to . ",0
the aaa rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees . ,0
"dropbox will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for claims less than $ 75,000 . ",0
"if you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim , we will pay you $ 1,000 in addition to the award . ",0
dropbox will not seek its attorneys ' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous . ,0
exceptions to agreement to arbitrate . ,0
"either you or dropbox may assert claims , if they qualify , in small claims court in san francisco -lrb- ca -rrb- or any united states county where you live or work . ",0
"either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the services , or intellectual property infringement -lrb- for example , trademark , trade secret , copyright , or patent rights -rrb- without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above . ",0
"if the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim , you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in san francisco county , california to resolve your claim . ",1
"you may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis , and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class , consolidated , or representative action . ",0
"class arbitrations , class actions , private attorney general actions , and consolidation with other arbitrations are n't allowed . ",0
"if this specific paragraph is held unenforceable , then the entirety of this `` mandatory arbitration provisions '' section will be deemed void . ",0
these terms will be governed by california law except for its conflicts of laws principles . ,1
"however , some countries -lrb- including those in the european union -rrb- have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer 's country . ",0
this paragraph does n't override those laws . ,0
"these terms constitute the entire agreement between you and dropbox with respect to the subject matter of these terms , and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements , or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these terms . ",0
these terms create no third party beneficiary rights . ,0
dropbox 's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later . ,0
"if a provision is found unenforceable , the remaining provisions of the terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible . ",0
"you may not assign any of your rights under these terms , and any such attempt will be void . ",0
"dropbox may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries , or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the services . ",0

the federal arbitration act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision . ,0
arbitration will be initiated through the american arbitration association -lrb- `` aaa '' -rrb- . ,0
"if the aaa is not available to arbitrate , the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum . ",0
"the rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration , except to the extent those rules conflict with these terms . ",0
the aaa consumer arbitration rules -lrb- `` aaa rules '' -rrb- governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the aaa at 1-800-778-7879 . ,0
the arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator . ,0
"if the claim is for $ 10,000 or less , the party initiating the arbitration may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted -lrb- 1 -rrb- solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing ; or -lrb- 3 -rrb- by an in-person hearing as established by the aaa rules in the county of your billing address . ",0
"in the case of an in-person hearing , the proceedings will be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient for both parties with due consideration of the ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances . ",0
"if the parties are unable to agree on a location , the determination will be made by the arbitration institution . ",0
your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the aaa rules with the remainder paid by headspace . ,0
"if the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose -lrb- as measured by the standards set forth in federal rule of civil procedure 11 -lrb- b -rrb- -rrb- , then the payment of all fees will be governed by the aaa rules . ",0
"in such case , you agree to reimburse headspace for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the aaa rules . ",0
"regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted , the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award , if any , are based . ",0
the arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator 's ruling on the merits . ,0

you may opt-out of this arbitration agreement . ,0
"if you do so , neither you nor headspace can force the other to arbitrate . ",0
