snap group limited terms of service ,0
-lrb- if you live outside the united states -rrb- ,0
"effective : january 10 , 2017 ",0
"we 're thrilled you 've decided to use snapchat and our other products and services , all of which we refer to simply as the `` services . '' ",0
we 've drafted these terms of service -lrb- which we call the `` terms '' -rrb- so you 'll know the rules that govern our relationship with you . ,0
"although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the terms , there are places where these terms may still read like a traditional contract . ",0
there 's a good reason for that : these terms do indeed form a legally binding contract between you and snap group limited . ,0
so please read them carefully . ,0
"by using the services , you agree to the terms . ",1
"of course , if you do n't agree with them , then do n't use the services . ",0
these terms apply to you if you live outside the united states or if you are using the services on behalf of a business located outside the united states . ,0
"if you live in the united states or are using the services on behalf of a business located there , the snap inc. . ",0
"arbitration notice : if you 're using the services on behalf of a business , then your business will be bound by the arbitration clause that appears later in these terms . ",0
no one under 13 is allowed to create an account or use the services . ,0
we may offer additional services with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them . ,0
so please read all terms carefully . ,0
"by using the services , you affirm that : ",0
you can form a binding contract with snap group limited . ,0
"you are not a person who is barred from receiving the services under the laws of the united states , the united kingdom , or any other applicable jurisdiction -- meaning that you do not appear on the u.s. treasury department 's list of specially designated nationals or face any other similar prohibition . ",0
"you will comply with these terms and all applicable local , state , national , and international laws , rules , and regulations . ",0
"if you are using the services on behalf of a business or some other entity , you affirm that you are authorized to grant all licenses set forth in these terms and to agree to these terms on behalf of the business or entity . ",0
"snap group limited grants you a personal , worldwide , royalty-free , non-assignable , nonexclusive , revocable , and non-sublicensable license to access and use the services . ",0
"this license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the services ' benefits in a way that these terms and our usage policies , such as our community guidelines , allow . ",0
"any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades , updates , or other new features . ",0
you may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device 's settings . ,0
"you may not copy , modify , distribute , sell , or lease any part of our services . ",0
"nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software , unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our written permission to do so . ",0
"many of our services let you create , upload , post , send , receive , and store content . ",0
"when you do that , you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with . ",0
but you grant us a license to use that content . ,0
how broad that license is depends on which services you use and the settings you have selected . ,0
"for all services other than live , local , and any other crowd-sourced service , you grant snap group limited , snap inc. , and their affiliates a worldwide , royalty-free , sublicensable , and transferable license to host , store , use , display , reproduce , modify , adapt , edit , publish , and distribute that content for as long as you use the services . ",0
"this license is for the limited purpose of operating , developing , providing , promoting , and improving the services and researching and developing new ones . ",0
"because live , local , and any other crowd-sourced services are inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest , the license you grant us for content submitted to those services is broader . ",0
"in addition to granting us the rights mentioned in the previous paragraph , you also grant us a license to create derivative works from , promote , exhibit , broadcast , syndicate , sublicense , publicly perform , and publicly display content submitted to live , local , or any other crowd-sourced services in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods -lrb- now known or later developed -rrb- . ",0
"to the extent it 's necessary , when you appear in , create , upload , post , or send live , local , or other crowd-sourced content , you also grant snap group limited , snap inc. , and our affiliates and business partners the unrestricted , worldwide right and license to use your name , likeness , and voice . ",0
"this means , among other things , that you will not be entitled to any compensation from snap group limited , snap inc. , or our affiliates and business partners if your name , likeness , or voice is conveyed through live , local , or other crowd-sourced services , either on the snapchat application or on one of our business partner 's platforms . ",0
"for more information about how to tailor who can watch your content , please take a look at our privacy policy and support site . ",0
"while we 're not required to do so , we may access , review , screen , and delete your content at any time and for any reason , including if we think your content violates these terms . ",1
"you alone , though , remain responsible for the content you create , upload , post , send , or store through the services . ",0
the services may contain advertisements . ,0
"in consideration for snap group limited letting you access and use the services , you agree that we , snap inc. , our affiliates , and our third-party partners may place advertising on the services , including personalized advertising based upon the information you provide us or we collect or obtain about you . ",0
"because the services contain content that you and other users provide us , advertising may sometimes appear near your content . ",0
we always love to hear from our users . ,0
"but if you volunteer feedback or suggestions , just know that we can use your ideas without compensating you . ",0
"much of the content on our services is produced by users , publishers , and other third parties . ",0
"whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately , the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that submitted it . ",0
"although snap group limited reserves the right to review all content that appears on the services and to remove any content that violates these terms , we do not necessarily review all of it . ",0
so we can not -- and do not -- take responsibility for any content that others provide through the services . ,0
"through these terms and our community guidelines , we make clear that we do not want the services put to bad uses . ",0
"but because we do not review all content , we can not guarantee that content on the services will always conform to our terms or guidelines . ",0
your privacy matters to us . ,0
you can learn how your information is handled when you use our services by reading the privacy policy . ,0
"we encourage you to give the privacy policy a careful look because , by using our services , you agree that your information may be collected and processed by snap group limited in the uk and snap inc. in the u.s. , as well as their affiliates , and transferred outside of the country in which you reside , including to countries that may not have the same data-protection laws as your country . ",1
snap group limited respects the rights of others . ,0
you therefore may not use the services in a manner that : ,0
"violates or infringes someone else 's rights of publicity , privacy , copyright , trademark , or other intellectual-property right . ",0
"bullies , harasses , or intimidates . ",0
spams or solicits our users . ,0
"you must also respect the rights of snap group limited and its affiliates , including snap inc. . ",0
these terms do not grant you any right to : ,0
"use branding , logos , designs , photographs , videos , or any other materials used in our services . ",0
"copy , archive , download , upload , distribute , syndicate , broadcast , perform , display , make available , or otherwise use any portion of the services or the content on the services except as set forth in these terms . ",0
"use the services , any tools provided by the services , or any content on the services for any commercial purposes without our consent . ",0
in short : you may not use the services or the content on the services in ways that are not authorized by these terms . ,0
nor may you help anyone else in doing so . ,0
we therefore take reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our services any infringing material that we become aware of . ,0
"and if snap group limited becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights , we will take reasonable steps within our power to terminate the user 's account . ",1
we make it easy for you to report suspected copyright infringement . ,0
"if you believe that anything on the services infringes a copyright that you own or control , please fill out this form . ",0
or you may file a notice with our designated agent : ,0
"if you file a notice with our copyright agent , it must : ",0
contain the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner . ,0
identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed . ,0
"identify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed , or access to which is to be disabled , and information reasonably sufficient to let us locate the material . ",0
"provide your contact information , including your address , telephone number , and an email address . ",0
"provide a personal statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner , its agent , or the law . ",0
"provide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and , under penalty of perjury , that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner . ",0
we try hard to keep our services a safe place for all users . ,0
but we ca n't guarantee it . ,0
that 's where you come in . ,0
"by using the services , you agree that : ",0
you will not use the services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited in these terms . ,0
"you will not use any robot , spider , crawler , scraper , or other automated means or interface to access the services or extract other user 's information . ",0
you will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the services or other users ' content or information without our written consent . ,0
"you will not use the services in a way that could interfere with , disrupt , negatively affect , or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the services , or that could damage , disable , overburden , or impair the functioning of the services . ",0
"you will not use or attempt to use another user 's account , username , or password without their permission . ",0
you will not solicit login credentials from another user . ,0
"you will not post content that contains pornography , graphic violence , threats , hate speech , or incitements to violence . ",0
you will not upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the services . ,0
"you will not attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ , or attempt to access areas or features of the services that you are not authorized to access . ",0
"you will not probe , scan , or test the vulnerability of our services or any system or network . ",0
you will not encourage or promote any activity that violates these terms . ,0
we also care about your safety while using our services . ,0
so do not use our services in a way that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws . ,0
"for example , never snap and drive . ",0
and never put yourself or others in harm 's way just to capture a snap . ,0
you are responsible for any activity that occurs in your snapchat account . ,0
so it 's important that you keep your account secure . ,0
one way to do that is to select a strong password that you do n't use for any other account . ,0
"by using the services , you agree that , in addition to exercising common sense : ",0
you will not create more than one account for yourself . ,0
"you will not create another account if we have already disabled your account , unless you have our written permission to do so . ",0
"you will not buy , sell , rent , or lease access to your snapchat account , live , snaps , a snapchat username , or a friend link without our written permission . ",0
you will not share your password . ,0
you will not log in or attempt to access the services through unauthorized third-party applications or clients . ,0
"if you think that someone has gained access to your account , please immediately reach out to snapchat support . ",0
"memories is our data-storage service that makes it easier for you to reminisce anytime , anywhere . ",0
"by agreeing to these terms , you automatically enable memories . ",0
"once memories is enabled , it will remain enabled for as long as you maintain your snapchat account . ",0
but you can always turn off certain memories features through settings . ,0
"one of the options we provide with memories is the ability to create a restricted area by setting a passcode , which might be a pin or a passphrase or some other mechanism . ",0
"this is similar to the device-lock option you may be using on your mobile device ; by setting a passcode , you make it less likely that another person who gets ahold of your device will be able to see what you saved to the restricted area of memories . ",0
"but here 's a big warning : if you lose or forget your memories passcode , or if you enter the wrong one too many times , you will lose access to any content you saved in the restricted area of memories . ",0
we do n't offer any passcode recovery features for this restricted area . ,0
you are solely responsible for remembering your passcode . ,0
please go to our support site for more details on passcodes . ,0
"your content in memories might become unavailable for any number of reasons , including things like an operational glitch or a decision on our end to terminate your account . ",1
"since we ca n't promise that your content will always be available , we recommend keeping a separate copy of the content you save to memories . ",0
we make no promise that memories will be able to accommodate your precise storage needs . ,0
"we reserve the right to set storage limits for memories , and we may change these limits from time to time in our sole discretion . ",1
"and just as with our other services , your use of memories may take up space on your device and may incur mobile data charges . ",0
you may not resell any memories features . ,0
this means you ca n't do something like use memories to operate your own file-storage or distribution service for other people . ,0
"you are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our services , including text-messaging and data charges . ",0
"if you 're unsure what those charges may be , you should ask your service provider before using the services . ",0
"if you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to create a snapchat account , you must update your account information through settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending to someone else messages intended for you . ",0
"if you use a service , feature , or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our services -lrb- including services we jointly offer with the third party -rrb- , each party 's terms will govern the respective party 's relationship with you . ",0
neither snap group limited nor snap inc. is responsible or liable for a third party 's terms or actions taken under the third party 's terms . ,0
we 're relentlessly improving our services and creating new ones all the time . ,0
"that means we may add or remove features , products , or functionalities , and we may also suspend or stop the services altogether . ",1
"we may take any of these actions at any time , and when we do , we will try to notify you beforehand , but this wo n't always be possible . ",1
"while we hope you remain a lifelong snapchatter , you can terminate these terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account . ",0
"snap group limited may also terminate these terms with you at any time , for any reason . ",1
"and while we 'll try to give you advance notice , we ca n't guarantee it . ",0
"our right to terminate these terms means that we may stop providing you with any services , or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use the services . ",1
"for example , we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity , and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason . ",1
"regardless of who terminates these terms , both you and snap group limited continue to be bound by sections 3 , 6 , 9 , 10 , and 13-22 of the terms . ",0
"you agree , to the extent permitted by law , to indemnify , defend , and hold harmless snap group limited , snap inc. , and our affiliates , directors , officers , stockholders , employees , licensors , and agents from and against any complaints , charges , claims , damages , losses , costs , liabilities , and expenses -lrb- including attorneys ' fees -rrb- due to , arising out of , or relating in any way to : -lrb- a -rrb- your access to or use of the services ; -lrb- b -rrb- your content ; and -lrb- c -rrb- your breach of these terms . ",0
we try to keep the services up and running and free of annoyances . ,0
but we make no promises that we will succeed . ,0
"the services are provided `` as is '' and `` as available '' and to the extent permitted by law without warranties of any kind , either express or implied , including , but not limited to , implied warranties , conditions , or other terms relating to merchantability , satisfactory quality , fitness for a particular purpose , title , quiet enjoyment , non-infringement , or arising from a course of dealing . ",0
"in addition , while snap group limited attempts to provide a good user experience , we do not represent or warrant that : -lrb- a -rrb- the services will always be secure , error-free , or timely ; -lrb- b -rrb- the services will always function without delays , disruption , or imperfections ; or -lrb- c -rrb- that any content or information you obtain through the services will be timely or accurate . ",0
"snap group limited , snap inc. , and their affiliates take no responsibility and assume no liability for any content that you , another user , or a third party creates , uploads , posts , sends , receives , or stores on or through our services . ",1
"you understand and agree that you may be exposed to content that might be offensive , illegal , misleading , or otherwise inappropriate , none of which snap group limited , snap inc. , nor their affiliates will be responsible for . ",0
"when permitted by law , snap group limited , snap inc. , and our affiliates , directors , officers , stockholders , employees , licensors , and agents , will not be liable for any indirect , incidental , special , consequential , punitive , or multiple damages , or any loss of profits or revenues , whether incurred directly or indirectly , or any loss of data , use , goodwill , or other intangible losses , resulting from : -lrb- a -rrb- your use of the services or inability to use the services ; -lrb- b -rrb- your access to or inability to access the services ; -lrb- c -rrb- the conduct or content of other users or third parties on or through the services ; or -lrb- d -rrb- unauthorized access , use , or alteration of your content , even if snap group limited has been advised of the possibility of such damages . ",1
"in no event will snap group limited , snap inc. , or their affiliates ' aggregate liability for all claims relating to the services exceed the greater of # 100 gbp or the amount you paid snap group limited , if any , in the last 12 months . ",1
"some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages , so some or all of the exclusions and limitations in this section may not apply to you . ",0
"if you have a concern , let 's talk . ",0
go ahead and contact us first and we 'll do our best to resolve the issue . ,0
some of our services may have additional terms that contain dispute-resolution provisions unique to that service or your residency . ,0
"if you are using the services on behalf of a business -lrb- rather than for your personal use -rrb- , you and snap group limited agree that to the extent permitted by law , all claims and disputes between us arising out of or relating to these terms or the use of the services will be finally settled under the lcia arbitration rules , which are incorporated by reference into this clause . ",0
"there will be one arbitrator -lrb- to be appointed by the lcia -rrb- , the arbitration will take place in london , and the arbitration will be conducted in english . ",0
"if you do not wish to agree to this clause , you must not use the services . ",0
"to the extent the parties are permitted under these terms to initiate litigation in a court , both you and snap group limited agree that all claims and disputes -lrb- whether contractual or otherwise -rrb- arising out of or relating to the terms or the use of the services will be litigated exclusively in the courts of england in the united kingdom , unless this is prohibited by the laws of the country where you reside . ",1
you and snap group limited consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts . ,1
the laws of england and wales govern these terms and any claims and disputes -lrb- whether contractual or otherwise -rrb- arising out of or relating to these terms or their subject matter . ,1

arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court . ,0

there may be more limited discovery than in court . ,0

"any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within one -lrb- 1 -rrb- year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act , omission , or default giving rise to the claim ; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period .

"if applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims , any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law . ",0
"a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other , by certified mail or federal express -lrb- signature required -rrb- , or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you , by electronic mail -lrb- `` notice '' -rrb- . ",0
"spotify 's address for notice is : spotify , attn : general counsel , 45 w. 18th street , 7th floor , new york , new york 10011 , usa . ",0

",0
all documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of arbitrator 's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law . ,0
"except as required to enforce the arbitrator 's decision and award , neither you nor spotify shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration , including , but not limited to , the fact that the parties are in dispute , the existence of the arbitration , or any decision or award of the arbitrator .

",0
"if the class action waiver at section 24.2 is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of this section 24.3 is found to be invalid or unenforceable , then the entirety of this section 24.3 shall be null and void and , in such case , the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in section 24.1 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the agreements .

"if you have any questions concerning the spotify service or the agreements , please contact spotify customer service by visiting the about us section of our website . ",0

some states or countries do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitations/exclusions of liability described above . ,0
so these limitations/exclusions may not apply to you if you reside in one of those states or countries . ,0
"if you use or misuse the service , or if you violate these terms or any other applicable rules , including the community rules or feature terms , and that results in loss or damage or in a claim or liability against zynga or any zynga affiliate , you agree to indemnify , defend and hold harmless zynga and/or the zynga affiliate -lrb- which means you agree to compensate zynga and/or the zynga affiliate on a `` dollar for dollar '' basis -rrb- for that loss , damage , claim or liability , including compensating zynga and/or the applicable zynga affiliate for our legal fees or expenses .

this section only applies to players in the us and canada . ,0
"if you are having a problem with the service , many issues can be resolved on one of our forums . ",0
"for issues relating to certain naturalmotion games , you may find resolution by clicking on the `` support '' link on that game 's page on naturalmotion 's website . ",0
"before bringing a formal legal case , first contact our customer support team at https://zyngasupport.helpshift.com , or for black diamond slots , email support@risingtidegames.com , or for natural motion games email contact@naturalmotion.com to address your issue most disputes can be resolved that way . ",0
"if we ca n't resolve our dispute through customer service , you and zynga or any member of the zynga corporate family all agree to resolve any claims relating to the terms , the privacy policy , feature terms or zynga 's services through final and binding arbitration . ",1
"this applies to all kinds of claims under any legal theory , unless the claim fits in one of the exceptions in the exceptions to agreement to arbitrate sub-section . ",0
it also applies even after you stopped using your zynga account or deleted it . ,0
"an arbitration proceeding is before a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge and jury , so we are all giving up our right to a trial before a judge and jury . ",0
arbitrations have different rules than lawsuits in court . ,0
"they are less formal than lawsuits in courts , and provide limited opportunity to force the other side to share information relevant to the dispute -- a process called discovery . ",0
the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual . ,0
"but , if any of us does not like the arbitrator 's decision , the courts only have a limited ability to change the outcome of arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her decision . ",0
"if we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to our dispute , we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that , too . ",0
"in addition , if you , zynga or a zynga corporate family member brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or any of us refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated , the other of us can ask a court to force us to go to arbitration to resolve the claim -lrb- i.e. , compel arbitration -rrb- . ",0
"you , zynga or the zynga corporate family member may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing . ",0
"the american arbitration association -lrb- aaa -rrb- will run the arbitration between you and zynga or the zynga corporate family member , and aaa 's then-current rules and procedures -lrb- including their supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes -rrb- will be used . ",0
"if something in these terms is different than aaa 's rules and procedures , then we will follow these terms instead . ",0
you can look at aaa 's rules and procedures on their website www.adr.org or you can call them at 1-800-778-7879 . ,0
"to start an arbitration proceeding , use the form on aaa 's website -lrb- www.adr.org -rrb- or call them at 1-800-778-7879 . ",0
we all agree that we will go to court to resolve disputes relating to ,0
"your , zynga 's , or a zynga corporate family member 's intellectual property -lrb- for example , trademarks , trade dress , domain names , trade secrets , copyrights or patents -rrb- ; or ",0
your violation of the community rules . ,0
"for more information about which court we can go to for resolving these types of disputes , see section 19 -lrb- venue for legal disputes not subject to arbitration -rrb- . ",0
we all agree that we can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis . ,0
"neither you nor zynga nor any member of the zynga corporate family can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action , consolidated action or representative action . ",0
"the arbitrator can not combine more than one person 's claim into a single case , and can not preside over any consolidated , class or representative arbitration proceeding -lrb- unless we both agree to change this -rrb- . ",0
"the arbitrator 's decision or award in one person 's case can only impact the person who brought the claim , not other zynga players , and can not be used to decide other disputes with other players . ",0
"if a court decides that this subsection on `` no class actions '' is not enforceable or valid , then the entire section 17 -lrb- agreement to arbitrate and class action waiver -rrb- will be null and void -lrb- i.e. , go away -rrb- . ",0
"but , the rest of the terms , feature terms , community rules , and privacy policy will still apply . ",0
changes to section 17 on agreement to arbitrate and class action waiver ,0
we will give you 60-days ' notice by email or through the service if we change section 17 on our agreement to arbitrate and class action waiver . ,0
the federal arbitration act -lrb- including its procedural provisions -rrb- is the law that will be applied to determine whether section 17 -lrb- agreement to arbitrate and class action waiver -rrb- can be enforced and how it should be interpreted . ,0
"apart from that , if you are united states resident , these terms and our relationship will be governed by california law , except for its conflicts of laws principles . ",1
"if you reside outside the united states these terms and our relationship will be governed by irish law , except for its conflicts of laws principles . ",1
venue for legal disputes not subject to arbitration ,0
"if you are a united states resident , judicial proceedings -lrb- other than small claims actions -rrb- that are excluded from the arbitration agreement in section 17 must be brought in state or federal court in san francisco , california , unless we both agree to some other location you and zynga both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in san francisco , california . ",1
"if you reside outside the united states , judicial proceedings must be brought in the courts of ireland , unless we both agree to some other location , and you and zynga both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in ireland . ",1
"except as described in section 17 under the `` no class actions '' heading , if any part of these terms , feature terms , community rules or the privacy policy is not enforceable , the rest of these terms , feature terms , community rules and the privacy policy still applies and is binding and any unenforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible .

"we may give our rights , or our obligations , under these terms , feature terms , community rules , or our privacy policy to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent . ",0
"you may not give your rights or your obligations under these terms , feature terms , community rules , or our privacy policy without first getting zynga 's written consent , and any attempt to do so without our consent is void . ",0
"these terms , and any other policies or rules we reference in these terms , make up the entire agreement between you and us relating to the subject matter of these terms , and supersede all prior understandings of the parties relating to the subject matter of these terms , whether those prior understandings were electronic , oral or written , or whether established by custom , practice , policy or precedent , between you and us . ",0
"if we provide a translated version of these terms , feature terms , the community rules , the zynga privacy policy , or any other terms or policy , it is for informational purposes only . ",0
"if the translated version means something different than the english version , then the english meaning will be the one that applies . ",0
"if we do not enforce a provision of these terms , feature terms , the community rules , or our privacy policy , that does not waive our right to do so later . ",0
"and , if we do expressly waive a provision of these terms , feature terms , the community rules , or our privacy policy that does not mean it is waived for all time in the future . ",0
any waiver must be in writing and signed by both you and us to be legally binding . ,0
"we may notify you by posting something on www.zynga.com , or in the zynga game -lrb- s -rrb- you play , and sending you an e-mail or using other ways of communicating with you based on the contact information you provide to us . ",0
"if you are a player in the united states , and you have to give us notice of something according to the terms , feature terms , community rules , or our privacy policy , the notice must be in writing and addressed to zynga inc. , attn : legal department , 699 8th street , san francisco , ca 94103 , unless we have provided a more specific method way of notifying us .

any attempted notice that does not follow these rules has no legal effect . ,0
"you agree that given the unique and irreplaceable nature of the rights granted and obligations made under these terms and the community rules , if you breach these terms , feature terms , community rules and/or our privacy policy , or intend to breach these terms , feature terms , community rules or privacy policy , money damages alone will not be enough to repair the harm to zynga . ",0
"therefore , for disputes that are not required to be resolved through arbitration as described in section 17 , zynga may seek injunctive or other equitable relief -lrb- e.g. , get a court order to make you stop doing whatever you 're doing that is causing harm -rrb- if you breach or intend to breach these terms , feature terms , community rules or our privacy policy and zynga does not have to post any bond or surety or submit proof of damages . ",0
"you agree to limit your claims to claims for money damages , as limited by section 15 -lrb- limitations ; waivers of liability -rrb- . ",0
"and , you agree not to seek injunctive or equitable relief or otherwise seek to stop us from operating any aspect of the service or any zynga game . ",0
"we are not liable for any changes or problems out of our control , for example changes or problems caused by like natural disasters , war , terrorism , riots , embargoes , acts of civil or military authorities , fire , floods , accidents , network infrastructure failures , strikes , or shortages of transportation facilities , fuel , energy , labor or materials .
